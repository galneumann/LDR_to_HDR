## HDR Image Reconstruction Using Segmented Image Learning
Overview: This repository contains a deep learning method to convert LDR image into HDR image, the method we used is to segment the bright and dark regions from an input LDR image and reconstruct the corresponding HDR image with similar dynamic ranges in the real world.
